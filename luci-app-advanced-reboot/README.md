If your device is not in the list above, however it is a [dual-firmware device](https://openwrt.org/tag/dual_firmware?do=showtag&tag=dual_firmware) and you're interested in having your device supported, please refer to [How to add a new device](#how-to-add-a-new-device).

The package in the official OpenWrt repo only supports the routers supported in the official snapshots or release builds. In rare cases, the package in my own private repo may support routers not yet supported in the package from the official OpenWrt repo.

## How to install

Install `luci-app-advanced-reboot` from Web UI or connect to your router via ssh and run the following commands:

```sh
opkg update
opkg install luci-app-advanced-reboot
```

If the `luci-app-advanced-reboot` package with support of your device is not found in the official feed/repo for your version of OpenWrt, you will need to add a custom repo to your router following instructions on [GitHub](https://docs.openwrt.melmac.net/#on-your-router)/[jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stangri/docs.openwrt.melmac.net/README.md#on-your-router) first.

## How to add a new device

This package does not implement dual-firmware support to the OpenWrt device, rather it uses built-in OpenWrt tools to browse/switch partitions on dual-firmware devices supported by OpenWrt (usually by the device maintainer/committer into the OpenWrt tree).

The dual-firmware devices need to be explicitly supported by this package (there's no auto-discovery of supported models). If you are interested in having a device supported by this package, you can either create the support file yourself or request it.

### Requesting Support

Please post in the [OpenWrt Forum Support Thread](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/3423) the following information:

- Link to the device OpenWrt wiki Table of Hardware page and/or link to the git commit to OpenWrt tree with support of the device being added.
- The output of the following commands from the console:

  ```sh
  ubus call system board
  cat /tmp/sysinfo/board_name
  cat /proc/mtd
  fw_printenv
  ```

### Adding Device Support Yourself

To support a new device, you need to create a `.json` file that tells the Advanced Reboot app how your router switches partitions.

#### Step 1: Get the Board Name

Log into your router via SSH and run:

```bash
cat /tmp/sysinfo/board_name
```

This string (e.g., `linksys,mx4200v1`) goes into the `board` list in your JSON file.

#### Step 2: Identify Boot Variables

Find out which environment variables change when you switch partitions.

1. Run `fw_printenv` to see current settings.
2. Look for variables like `boot_part`, `bootcmd`, or `boot_part_ready`.
3. Note their values for Partition 1 vs. Partition 2.

_If your device doesn't use environment variables (like some ZyXEL models), it might use a "dual-boot flag" bytes on a specific partition._

#### Step 3: Identify Partitions

Run `cat /proc/mtd` to see your partitions. You need to find:

- The MTD device for Partition 1 (e.g., `mtd21`, `firmware`).
- The MTD device for Partition 2 (e.g., `mtd23`, `alt_firmware`).
- (Optional) An offset to find the "OpenWrt" label.

#### Step 4: Write the JSON File

Create a file named `your-device-model.json`. Use the template below:

**Example (Environment Variable Method):**

```json
{
  "device": {
    "vendor": "Linksys",
    "model": "MX4200v1",
    "board": ["linksys,mx4200v1"]
  },
  "commands": {
    "params": ["boot_part"],
    "get": "fw_printenv",
    "set": "fw_setenv",
    "save": null
  },
  "partitions": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "param_values": ["1"],
      "mtd": "mtd21",
      "labelOffsetBytes": 192
    },
    {
      "number": 2,
      "param_values": ["2"],
      "mtd": "mtd23",
      "labelOffsetBytes": 192
    }
  ]
}
```

- **device**: Vendor, Model, and the board name from Step 1.
- **commands**:
  - `params`: The variable names from Step 2.
  - `get`/`set`: Usually `fw_printenv` and `fw_setenv`.
- **partitions**:
  - `number`: 1 or 2.
  - `param_values`: The values for the variables in `params` (must be in the same order).
  - `mtd`: The MTD identifier (e.g., `mtd21`).
  - `labelOffsetBytes`: Where to look for the OS label (try 32, 64, or 192).

#### Push the JSON to the Router

Use `scp` (Secure Copy) to transfer your file to the router.

**Command:**

```bash
scp your-device-model.json root@192.168.1.1:/usr/share/advanced-reboot/devices/
```

_(Replace `192.168.1.1` with your router's IP address)_

If that directory doesn't exist yet, create it on the router first:

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/share/advanced-reboot/devices/
```

#### Test with CLI Commands

After copying the file, log in to the router and test it using `ubus` commands.

1.  **Check if the device is recognized**:

    ```bash
    ubus -v call luci.advanced-reboot obtain_device_info
    ```

    You should see your device info and partition status.

2.  **Test Partition Switching** (Warning: effectively reboots/changes boot env!):

    ```bash
    ubus -S call luci.advanced-reboot boot_partition '{ "number": "1" }'
    ubus -S call luci.advanced-reboot boot_partition '{ "number": "2" }'
    ```

## Notes/Known Issues

- The package in the official OpenWrt repo only supports the routers supported in the official snapshots or release builds. In rare cases, the package in my own private repo may support routers not yet supported in the package from the official OpenWrt repo.
- When you reboot to a different partition, your current settings (WiFi SSID/password, etc.) will not apply to a different partition. Different partitions might have completely different settings and even firmware.
- If you reboot to a partition which doesn't allow you to switch boot partitions (like stock vendor firmware), you might not be able to boot back to OpenWrt unless you reflash it, losing all the settings.
- Some devices allow you to trigger reboot to an alternative partition by interrupting boot 3 times in a row (by resetting/switching off the device or pulling power). As these methods might be different for different devices, do your own homework.
- Newer versions of this package try to mount alternative partition on compatible NAND routers in order to retrieve detailed firmware information. When that happens, it is normal to have messages similar to the below in the system log:
