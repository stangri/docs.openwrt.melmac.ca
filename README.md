# The openwrt.melmac.ca packages documentation

This is documentation for packages for OpenWrt devices created/maintained under the Melmac Open Source Software Development Foundation (MOSSDeF). While some of these are packages are already available from official OpenWrt release/snapshots repositories/feeds, [the ipk packages repo](https://repo.openwrt.melmac.ca)/[the apk packages repo](https://apk.openwrt.melmac.ca) usually contain newer versions. You can also browse/check-out the [source code](https://source.openwrt.melmac.ca).

The ipk binaries repository is currently hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com). If you have problems accessing [my ipk packages repo](https://repo.openwrt.melmac.ca) or access to [GitHub](https://github.com) may be blocked at the location where your router is installed, skip to the [Add OPKG/IPK repository to your OpenWrt device (jsDelivr)](#add-opkgipk-repository-to-your-openwrt-device-jsdelivr) section. Both repositories use HTTPS protocol and require one of the SSL support packages to be installed on your router.

##### Add OPKG/IPK repository to your OpenWrt device (GitHub)

```sh
opkg update
opkg install wget-ssl
echo -e -n 'untrusted comment: OpenWrt usign key of Stan Grishin\nRWR//HUXxMwMVnx7fESOKO7x8XoW4/dRidJPjt91hAAU2L59mYvHy0Fa\n' > /etc/opkg/keys/7ffc7517c4cc0c56
