## Description

AdBlock-Fast is a high-performance ad-blocking service for OpenWrt that integrates with **Dnsmasq**, **SmartDNS**, and **Unbound**. It supports parallel downloading and processing of remote block- and allow-lists, optimizing them into efficient resolver-compatible formats.

Unlike traditional solutions, AdBlock-Fast does **not** run as a background service — it performs its tasks and exits, leaving minimal memory usage. It also supports a **lean mode**, allowing direct use of pre-built dnsmasq config files without processing.

An optional LuCI Web UI (`luci-app-adblock-fast`) makes configuration easy, including adding custom block/allow lists. Both the core package and the Web UI are available in the **official OpenWrt package repositories**.

Starting with version 1.1.4, AdBlock-Fast performs a DNS resolver configuration test before restarting the resolver and runs a post-restart health check to verify working DNS resolution. If the health check fails, the service can automatically revert to the previous known-good state without ad-blocking to maintain internet connectivity.

## Why AdBlock-Fast?

**AdBlock-Fast** is designed for performance and simplicity. It processes block-lists in parallel and exits after generating optimized configuration for your DNS resolver—no background daemons, no memory bloat.

- **Blazing fast startup**: Downloads and parses block-lists concurrently, significantly reducing startup time.
- **Low memory footprint**: Only consumes memory during processing—no persistent background processes.
- **Highly flexible**: Supports multiple DNS backends including dnsmasq, smartdns, and unbound.
- **Web UI available**: Optional LuCI interface (`luci-app-adblock-fast`) provides easy configuration and management.
- **Modern DNS support**: Works with encrypted DNS (DoH) browsers via ipset/nftset integration.
- **Lean mode available**: Skip processing entirely by using pre-built dnsmasq config files.
- **Persistent cache option**: Saves a compressed block-list across reboots to save time and bandwidth.
- **Officially supported**: Both the core package and its Web UI (`luci-app-adblock-fast`) are available in the official OpenWrt repositories.

## Features

- Super-fast due to the nature of supported allow/block-lists, parallel downloading/processing of the block-lists and fast block-list parsing code.
- Supports [multiple remote allow/block-lists formats](#recognized-remote-allowblock-list-file-formats), as well as using a [remote dnsmasq config file](#dnsmasq_config_file_url) with no parsing.
- Everything is configurable from Web UI.
- Allows you to easily add your own domains to allow-list or block-list.
- Allows you to easily add URLs to your own blocked hosts or domains lists to allow/block-list (just put allowed domains one per line in the file you're linking).
- Supports multiple modes of ad-blocking implementations with Dnsmasq, SmartDNS and Unbound.
- Supports lean mode by quickly downloading and using (without processing, which can be resource/time-intensive on older devices) remote dnsmasq ad-blocking config file.
- Doesn't stay in memory -- creates the list of blocked domains and then uses Dnsmasq/SmartDNS/Unbound and firewall rules to serve NXDOMAIN or 127.0.0.1 reply or to reject access (depending on settings) for blocked domains.
- As some of the default lists are using https, reliably works with either wget/libopenssl, uclient-fetch/libustream-mbedtls or curl (recommended).
- Very lightweight and easily hackable, the whole script is just one `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast` file.
- Retains the downloaded/sorted ad-blocking list on service stop and reuses it on service start (use `dl` command if you want to force re-download of the list).
- Has an option to store a compressed copy of the ad-blocking list in persistent memory which survives reboots.
- Blocks ads served over https (unlike PixelServ-derived solutions).
- Blocks ads inside browsers with built-in [DNS-over-HTTPS proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS) enabled, like [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_about-dns-over-https) or [Google Chrome/Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/09/experimenting-with-same-provider-dns.html) -- with the `dnsmasq.ipset` or `dnsmasq.nftset` options (where supported by installed Dnsmasq).
- Proudly made in Canada, using locally-sourced electrons.

## Requirements

The required packages should be automatically installed when you install `adblock-fast`.

### Requirements for DNS Resolver

In order to actually block the ads, this service requires one of the following DNS resolvers to be installed on your router: `dnsmasq`, `dnsmasq-full`, `smartdns` or `unbound`. The `dnsmasq` package is usually included in the default OpenWrt installation.

If you want to use the [`dnsmasq.ipset` option](#dns-resolver-option) you need to install `ipset` and `dnsmasq-full` with `ipset` support instead of the `dnsmasq`.

If you want to use the [`dnsmasq.nftset` option](#dns-resolver-option) you need to install `dnsmasq-full` with `nftset` support instead of the `dnsmasq`.

By default, `dnsmasq-full` in OpenWrt 22.03 and earlier supports only `ipset`, the `dnsmasq-full` in OpenWrt 23.05 and later supports only `nftset`.

To upgrade from `dnsmasq` to `dnsmasq-full`, connect to your router via ssh and run the following command:

```sh
opkg update; cd /tmp/ && opkg download dnsmasq-full; opkg install ipset libnettle8 libnetfilter-conntrack3;
opkg remove dnsmasq; opkg install dnsmasq-full --cache /tmp/; rm -f /tmp/dnsmasq-full*.ipk;
```

### Requirements for IPv6 Support

All of the supported domain-based blocking options (`resolver` set to `dnsmasq.addnhosts`, `dnsmasq.conf`, `dnsmasq.servers`, `smartdns.domainset` and `unbound.adb_list`) are IP-family agnostic and should work with both IPv4 and IPv6 networking.

For IPv6 support using the IP-based blocking (`resolver` set to `dnsmasq.ipset`, `dnsmasq.nftset`, `smartdns.ipset` or `smartdns.nftset`) on OpenWrt 21.02 and earlier, additionally install `ip6tables-mod-nat` and `kmod-ipt-nat6` packages from Web UI or run the following in the command line:

```sh
opkg update; opkg install ip6tables-mod-nat kmod-ipt-nat6;
```

The IP-based blocking (`resolver` set to `dnsmasq.ipset`, `dnsmasq.nftset`, `smartdns.ipset` or `smartdns.nftset`) is not guaranteed to work on OpenWrt 22.03 due to the fact that the `dnsmasq-full` available in 22.03 repository only has support for `ipset`, not the `nftset`, however the default netfilter is `nft`, not `iptables`, I'd advise you to upgrade to OpenWrt 23.05 or newer if you need to switch to the IP-based blocking.

The IPv6 support is included by default in OpenWrt 23.05 and later images, so no additional steps are needed to enable IPv6 with IP-based blocking (`resolver` set to `dnsmasq.ipset`, `dnsmasq.nftset`, `smartdns.ipset` or `smartdns.nftset`) on OpenWrt 23.05 and later.

### Requirements for Faster Block-list Processing

The `gawk`, `grep`, `sed` and `coreutils-sort` are the optional, but recommended packages as they speed up processing dramatically. You can install these recommended packages by running the following command:

```sh
opkg --force-overwrite install gawk grep sed coreutils-sort
```

## Unmet Dependencies

If you are running a development (snapshot) build of OpenWrt on your router and your build is outdated (meaning that packages of the same revision/commit hash are no longer available and when you try to satisfy the [requirements](#requirements) you get errors), please flash either current OpenWrt release image or current development/snapshot image.

## How To Install

Install `adblock-fast` and `luci-app-adblock-fast` packages from Web UI or run the following in the command line:

```sh
opkg update; opkg install adblock-fast luci-app-adblock-fast
```

If `adblock-fast` and `luci-app-adblock-fast` packages are not found in the official feed/repo for your version of OpenWrt, you will need to add a custom repo to your router following instructions on [GitHub](https://docs.openwrt.melmac.net/#on-your-router)/[jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stangri/docs.openwrt.melmac.net/README.md#on-your-router) first.

## Default Settings

Default configuration has the service disabled (use Web UI to enable/start service or run `uci set adblock-fast.config.enabled=1; uci commit adblock-fast;`) and selected ad/malware lists suitable for routers with 64Mb RAM.

If your router has less then 64Mb RAM, edit the configuration file, located at `/etc/config/adblock-fast`. The configuration file has lists in ascending order starting with smallest ones and each list has a preceding comment indicating its size, comment out or delete the lists you don't want or your router can't handle.

## How To Customize

You can use Web UI (found in Services/Simple AdBlock) to add/remove/edit links to:

- [Hosts files](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)>) (127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 followed by space and domain name per line) to be blocked.
- Domains lists (one domain name per line) to be blocked.
- AdBlockPlus lists of domains to be blocked.
- Domains lists (one domain name per line) to be allowed. It is useful if you want to run `adblock-fast` on multiple routers and maintain one centralized allow-list which you can publish on a web-server.

Please note that these lists **must** include either `http://` or `https://` (or, if `curl` is installed the `file://`) prefix. Some of the top block-lists (both hosts files and domains lists) suitable for routers with at least 8MB RAM are used in the default `adblock-fast` installation.

You can also use Web UI to add individual domains to be blocked or allowed.

If you want to use CLI to customize `adblock-fast` config, refer to the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

### How To Use External Dnsmasq Config File

You can also configure `adblock-fast` to just fetch the pre-made dnsmasq config file, which it will download and use without further processing. To use this, you can quickly configure `adblock-fast` like:

```sh
uci set adblock-fast.config.dns='dnsmasq.conf'
uci set adblock-fast.dnsmasq_config_file_url='https://small.oisd.nl/dnsmasq2'
uci commit adblock-fast
service adblock-fast start
```

## How To Use

Once the service is enabled in the [config file](#default-settings), run `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast start` to start the service. Either `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast restart` or `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast reload` will only restart the service and/or re-download the lists if there were relevant changes in the config file since the last successful start. Had the previous start resulted in any error, either `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast start`, `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast restart` or `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast reload` will attempt to re-download the lists.

If you want to remove the domain(s) from the current block-list and add domain(s) to the config's allow-list, run `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast allow test-domain.com`.

If you want to check if the specific domain (or part of the domain name) is being blocked, run `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast check test-domain.com`.

If you want to force adblock-fast to re-download the lists, run `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast dl`.

### How to Schedule Redownloads

The command to force-redownload the lists is `/etc/init.d/adblock-fast dl` and this is what I use:

```sh
  echo '21 4 */3 * * /etc/init.d/adblock-fast dl' >> /etc/crontabs/root
```

## Adblock-fast Configuration

| `dnsmasq.addnhosts`  | Creates the Dnsmasq additional hosts file `/var/run/adblock-fast.addnhosts` and modifies Dnsmasq settings, so that Dnsmasq resolves all blocked domains to "local machine": 127.0.0.1. This option doesn't allow block-list optimization (by removing secondary level domains if the top-level domain is also in the block-list), so it results in a much larger block-list file, but, unlike other Dnsmasq-based options, it has almost no effect on the DNS look up speed. This option also allows quick reloads of Dnsmasq on block-list updates. This setting also allows you to configure which Dnsmasq instances would be affected by ad-blocking via `dnsmasq_instance` option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `dnsmasq.conf`       | Creates the Dnsmasq config file `/var/dnsmasq.d/adblock-fast.dnsmasq` so that Dnsmasq replies with NXDOMAIN: "domain not found". This option allows the block-list optimization (by removing secondary level domains if the top-level domain is also in the block-list), resulting in the smaller block-list file. This option also allows using top-level domains in the `blocked_domain` options to block the entire TLD. This option also allows the use of the `dnsmasq_config_file_url` setting which can be pointed to a pre-made `dnsmasq` config file which is used as is, without optimization or compressed cache creation. This option will slow down DNS look up speed somewhat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `dnsmasq.ipset`      | Creates the Dnsmasq ipset file `/var/dnsmasq.d/adblock-fast.dnsmasq` and the firewall rule to reject the matching requests. This is the only option for ad-blocking if you're using a browser with built-in [DNS-over-HTTPS proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS) enabled, like [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_about-dns-over-https) or [Google Chrome/Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/09/experimenting-with-same-provider-dns.html). This option allows the block-list optimization (by removing secondary level domains if the top-level domain is also in the block-list), resulting in the smaller block-list file. This option requires installation of `dnsmasq-full` and `ipset` packages.<br/>PLEASE NOTE, that unlike other options which are truly domain name based blocking, this is essentially an IP address based blocking, ie: if you try to block `google-analytics.com` with this option, it may also block/break things like YouTube, Hangouts and other Google services if they share IP address(es) with `google-analytics.com`.                                                                                                                                |
| `dnsmasq.nftset`     | Creates the Dnsmasq nft set file `/var/dnsmasq.d/adblock-fast.dnsmasq` and the firewall rule to reject the matching requests.

| `dnsmasq.servers`    | Creates the Dnsmasq servers file `/var/run/adblock-fast.servers` and modifies Dnsmasq settings so that Dnsmasq replies with NXDOMAIN: "domain not found".

This option allows the block-list optimization (by removing secondary level domains if the top-level domain is also in the block-list), resulting in the smaller block-list file. This option will slow down DNS look up speed somewhat. This is a recommended SmartDNS setting as it results in the smaller block-file and allows quick reloads of SmartDNS. This setting also allows you to configure which SmartDNS instances would be affected by ad-blocking via `smartdns_instance` option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `smartdns.ipset`     | Creates the SmartDNS ipset file and the firewall rule to reject the matching requests. This is the only option for ad-blocking if you're using a browser with [DNS-over-HTTPS proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS) built-in, like [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_about-dns-over-https) or [Google Chrome/Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/09/experimenting-with-same-provider-dns.html). This option allows the block-list optimization (by removing secondary level domains if the top-level domain is also in the block-list), resulting in the smaller block-list file. This option is recommended for OpenWrt 21.02 and earlier only.<br/>PLEASE NOTE, that unlike other options which are truly domain name based blocking, this is essentially an IP address based blocking, ie: if you try to block `google-analytics.com` with this option, it may also block/break things like YouTube, Hangouts and other Google services if they share IP address(es) with `google-analytics.com`.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Default config

The default config file installed with the package can be found at the [source repository](https://github.com/stangri/adblock-fast/blob/main/files/etc/config/adblock-fast). The config file contains some comments to explain some settings and the lists which are too big for most routers are commented out by default as well.

## How Does It Work

This service downloads (and processes in the background, removing comments and other useless data) lists of hosts and domains to be blocked, combines those lists into one big block-list, removes duplicates and sorts it and then removes your allowed domains from the block-list before converting to to Dnsmasq/SmartDNS/Unbound-compatible file and restarting Dnsmasq/SmartDNS/Unbound if needed. The result of the process is that Dnsmasq/SmartDNS/Unbound return NXDOMAIN or 127.0.0.1 (depending on settings) for the blocked domains.

If you specify `google.com` as a domain to be allowed, you will have access to `google.com`, `www.google.com`, `analytics.google.com`, but not fake domains like `email-google.com` or `drive.google.com.verify.signin.normandeassociation.com` for example. If you only want to allow `www.google.com` while blocking all other `google.com` subdomains, just specify `www.google.com` as domain to be allowed.

In general, whatever domain is specified to be allowed; it, along with with its subdomains will be allowed, but not any fake domains containing it.

### Recognized remote allow/block-list file formats

The service can parse the remote allow/block-lists in the following formats:

- AdBlockPlus format
- Dnsmasq format with `address=` assignments
- Dnsmasq format with `local=` assignments
- Dnsmasq format with `server=` assignments
- Hosts file
- Domains list (plain text with one domain per line)

## How It Does Not Work

For most of the [DNS Resolver Options](#dns-resolver-option) to work, your local LAN clients need to be set to use your router's DNS (by default `192.168.1.1`). The `dnsmasq.addnhosts` is the only option which can help you block ads if your local LAN clients are NOT using your router's DNS. There are multiple ways your local LAN clients can be set to NOT use your router's DNS:

1.  Hardcoded on the device. Some Android Lollipop 5.0 phones, some media-centric tablets and some streaming devices for example are known to have hardcoded DNS servers and they ignore your router's DNS settings. You can fix this by either:
    - Rooting your device and changing it from hardcoded DNS servers to obtaining DNS servers from DHCP.
    - Enabling `adblock-fast`'s `force_dns` setting to override the hardcoded DNS on your device.
2.  Manually set on the device. Instead of setting your device to obtain the DNS settings via DHCP, you can set the DNS servers manually. There are some guides online which recommend manually changing the DNS servers on your computer to Google's (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare's (1.1.1.1) or OpenDNS (208.67.222.222). You can fix this by either:
    - Changing the on-device DNS settings from manual to obtaining DNS servers from DHCP and changing your [router's DNS settings](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/dhcp#all_options) to use the DNS from Google, Cloudflare or OpenDNS respectively.
    - Enabling `adblock-fast`'s `force_dns` setting to override the hardcoded DNS on your device.
3.  Sent to your device from router via [DHCP Options](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/dhcp_configuration#dhcp_options). You can fix this by either:
    - Removing [DHCP Options](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/dhcp_configuration#dhcp_options) 5 and 6 from your router's `/etc/config/dhcp` file.
    - Enabling `adblock-fast`'s `force_dns` setting to override the hardcoded DNS on your device.
4.  By using the DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS or DNSCrypt on your local device or (if supported) by browser on your local device. You can fix this only by:
    - Stopping/removing/disabling DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS or DNSCrypt on your local device and using the secure DNS on your router instead. There are merits to all three of the options above, I can recommend the `https-dns-proxy` and `luci-app-https-dns-proxy` packages for enabling DNS-over-HTTPS on your router.
5.  If you are running a wireguard "server" on your router and remote clients connect to it, the ad-blocking may not work properly for your remote clients until you add the following to `/etc/network` (credit to [dibdot](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/wireguard-and-adblock/49351/6)):

    ```sh
    config route
      option interface 'wg0'
      option target '192.168.1.0'
      option netmask '255.255.255.0'
    ```

### Explanation of some warnings and errors

#### Internal version mismatch

When you visit the WebUI page of `luci-app-adblock-fast`, it checks the internal versions of 3 components:

- adblock-fast: internal version stamp of principal package
- luci-app-adblock-fast:
  - internal version stamp of the Javascript code you're seeing in the browser
  - internal version stamp of the RPCD script which pulls information from your device and supplies it to the Javascript code

Because of the way the principal app integrates with the WebUI, it is important that all three internal versions are in sync or at least the `luci-app-adblock-fast` internal versions are not lower than the `adblock-fast` internal version.

If you're seeing this message, make sure that the versions of the `adblock-fast` and `luci-app-adblock-fast` reported by `opkg` or `apk` on your device are the same by running:

```sh
command -v opkg > /dev/null 2>&1 && opkg list-installed | grep adblock-fast
command -v apk > /dev/null 2>&1 && apk list --installed | grep adblock-fast
```

If you have the matching versions of the `adblock-fast` and `luci-app-adblock-fast` installed you may still be seeing the Version Mismatch message.

- If the `luciCompat` is lower than `packageCompat`, it means that your browser has cached the Javascript code for WebUI, it may be outdated until you refresh/delete the browser cache (or open your device WebUI in Incognito mode or a different browser).
- If the `rpcdCompat` is lower than the `packageCompat`, it means that the `RPCD` service needs to be restarted (run `service rpcd restart` and re-login to WebUI or just reboot your device).
